<br>

**Some notes about the walkthrough:**  
- I won't be updating this walkthrough or the patch anymore. I recommend playing a game that's actually good, instead of this game.
- The walkthrough can be used with both the unpatched game and the patched game. I'd recommend using my patch, but the walkthrough can be followed exactly the same without it.
- Skipping the intro will prevent you from getting the day 1 romance point with the mom, so even if you are replaying the game you shouldn't skip the intro.
- If there is a choice or event that isn't mentioned in the walkthrough that means it's a choice that doesn't affect anything and you can choose any option.

# 9/13 (Tue)

- Bed -> Save game
- Go out the back door then go inside the garage and use the elevator

---

### The Hole:
- Explore all the rooms on Floor 2, break all the vases, and open all the chests
  - Using an antiandrogen will remove 30 arousal so use two once you get off the elevator
  - It's possible to clear the floor without taking any damage but I'll assume you took 30 damage while fighting and needed to use another antiandrogen to heal
  - A good strategy for exploring the floor is to go counterclockwise around the map
  - I'd recommend starting by going: Left -> Down -> Left, because in the third room a girl will charge at you as soon as you enter the room so it's best to go there when you start so you aren't caught off guard later
- When you've explored everywhere leave Floor 2 by using the elevator (Received magic book volume 2)

---

### My room:
- Bed -> Peephole
- Bed -> Sleep

3/4:
- Once you've played past the first week, if you reach 100 arousal the game will penalize you and you will deviate a bit from the walkthrough. If this happens then you should reload your your last save and use an antiandrogen to lower your arousal and make sure it doesn't reach 100.
